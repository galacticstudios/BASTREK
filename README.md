# Star Trek: The Other Game

 This is a *different* BASIC Star Trek game from the 1970s!

You might be familiar with the better-known Star Trek game from that time, which printed out charts of the current quadrant and the galaxy. [Wikipedia has an article about it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(1971_video_game))

But at the same time, there was another Star Trek game. It also involved a battle between your starship and an enemy, but it was script-based. Your orders, and Spock's, Sulu's, Chekov's and Uhura's responses, were printed out in scripted dialog form. [Wikipedia has a paragraph about it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Daglow#University_mainframe_games_in_the_1970s)

I played this game in the '70s at the Boston Museum of Science, where they had an ASR-33 dialed into a remote PDP-10. For 40 years, I've been looking for a copy of this game. I couldn't find any. Don Daglow, whose modified version of the original program was distributed by DECUS, didn't have it. I looked for an image of the DECUS tape, but never found it.

By luck, I was in a Facebook BASIC group in 2022 when Gary Boyer posted that he had a bunch of listings of Star Trek games from the 1970s. I told him about the script-based game and asked him to look for it. It turned out he had it!

**As far as I know, it is the only existing copy of the game!**

He scanned the printout and posted the images on FB. I downloaded them and I'm hosting them here, in the Scans directory.

According to Gary, he got the printouts at Lehigh University in 1975, when he was 12 years old! A little Googling revealed that Lehigh had a CDC 6000 system at the time. A little more Googling turned up the [manual for the CDC 6000's dialect of BASIC](http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/cdc/cyber/lang/basic/19980300B_BASIC_Language_Version_2_Reference_Nov74.pdf).

Source/CDC 6000/BASTREK.BAS contains my transcription of the program listing. If you find any errors, please let me know.

I welcome ports to other versions of BASIC and even other languages. I will host them under the Sources/ directory.
