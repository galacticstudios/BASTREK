This directory holds ports of the game to different platforms.

- The CDC 6000 directory has my transcription of the scanned images in the BASTREK/Scans directory. It is the basis for all other ports here.

- The DEC BASIC-PLUS directory has my port to that platform. I renamed the file to SCTREK.BAS ("Script Trek") and made some minor enhancements (handle lower case input, allow the user to enter command numbers, which the CDC version claims to support but doesn't).

- Other subdirectories have other people's ports.
